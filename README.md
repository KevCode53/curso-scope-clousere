# !["Javascript Logo"][1] **Scope and Clouseres**
------------
The course taught by platzi seeks to provide knowledge on the topics that are the Scope, what is a Closure and how Hosting works


## ScopeüéöÔ∏è

When mentioning the scope, it is made to understand that this is the scope that a variable or function has in the code, it is important to understand that there are several levels of scope.

- #### Scope Global
This reference is made when it is declared outside of a function or a block, and can be accessed from any part of the code regardless of whether it is inside or outside of a function or block.

- #### Scope Block
In this, access to a variable that is declared within a specific block is restricted from outside the block, where the **let** keywords are used, and **const**, which makes it easier to understand that they are variables with block scope.

- #### Scope Function
The function scope refers to the use and scope of a variable within a function, limiting its access only to the function where it is created.

## Clouseresüìù
To understand how the clousers work, it was emphasized that they are similar to functions that call another function, however it is noted that they save or store the value.

In this way, an example of a piggy bank was made, in which the clousere was started with a value of 0 (zero) and as the function was called, more was stored, and it was denoted that another clousere can be initialized and called and this one is not affects the value of what already existed. üí∞

## Hoistingüéà

To understand what elevation is, the explanation is given that Javascript will raise variables or functions as soon as they are called, so care should be taken with these since they can be undefined.

This is because Javascript will not look to see if the function or variable is initialized after its call, but rather, depending on how it is called, it rearranges itself to execute and initializes it by default as undefined.
